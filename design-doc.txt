BlockTag serialization format

Describes a content tree (kinda like json or sexp)

root block is implicitly present

leading, trailing whitespaces are ignored obvs

case-insensitive keys

blocks are encased in [Square braces]
blocks have a name (one word, leading, trailing spaces ignored)
after the name are 1 or more whitespaces
followed by the block's content:
	another block (starts with [), or
	an int (only contains digits), or
	a float (digits + one optional . or ,), or
	a string (optionally encased in " marks)
		in this case everything after the first chunk of wspaces is part of the content, including other wspaces
		if ] is used, encasing in " is necessary
		however " can freely be used inside the string (even if encased)
		
if a block has no content, it is called a tag
	in this case its presence (or absence) reps a boolean value
